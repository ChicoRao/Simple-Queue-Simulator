# Simple-Queue-Simulator

Simple C++ program that simulates a customer queue at the Department of Motor Vehicles counter. User is given three choices and they can choose their options by pressing 1, 2, or 3. 1 simulates a customer's arrival to the queue, 2 simulates a customer leaving the queue to the counter. 3 is to quit the program. This program demostrates queue's FIFO (first in first out) feature through simulating customers entering and leaving the line.
